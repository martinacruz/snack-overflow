# DELETE THIS FILE WHEN DONE

### Path to MVP

~~* Have a user be able to log in~~
  * Have them be able to do so reliably (we might be encountering an issue here, Tess is not having an issue so we may be working)
  * Seed user database with a couple of profiles and easy passwords to see if we can logout/log in, repeteadly (testing)
~~* User will be able to view their favorite snacks.~~
  * Seed snack database with snacks
~~* User will be able to add snacks to their favorite snacks.~~

## General Tasks
Use Trello more (lol)
* ~~Create a route to go to the snack page.~~
* ~~Create a link that take us to our snack page.~~
  * Add a button to profile page to put the user into the create route
~~* We need to create a route that will actually create a database entry of a new snack, with a name, description, and imgurl~~
~~* We need to create a form that will input all of that from the snack/snack~~

* Create an 'explore snacks page'
  * Add to create the page?
  * Seed the database with snacks
  * Create an add button to add the snack to the suser db via the join table (like Pokemon)

~~* Once a user creates an account for the first time, route them to the add-a-snack page.~~
